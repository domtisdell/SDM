## Key Findings and Remaining Data Gaps

### Successfully Updated from Low to High Confidence:
1. **Sectoral weights** - now based on comprehensive ABS and Infrastructure Australia data
2. **Construction/infrastructure product mix** - validated with industry sources
3. **Manufacturing transformation** - quantified post-automotive impacts
4. **Renewable energy factors** - established new baseline with empirical data

### Medium Confidence Improvements:
1. Semi-finished product breakdowns - producer data available but limited
2. Mining sector specifics - aggregate data available, limited product detail
3. Carbon specifications - industry standards identified, usage percentages estimated

### Remaining Low Confidence Areas:
1. **Other sectors detailed breakdown** - mining, agriculture, transport lack granular data
2. **Regional variations** - state-by-state differences not fully captured
3. **Import substitution patterns** - limited visibility on imported product specifications
4. **Future renewable specifications** - offshore wind still in planning phase

## Recommendations for Future Research

1. **Establish regular data collection** with Australian Steel Institute for quarterly updates
2. **Commission detailed mining sector study** to disaggregate the "Other" category
3. **Track offshore wind projects** as they progress from planning to construction
4. **Develop state-level models** to capture regional infrastructure variations
5. **Monitor green steel transition** impacts on product specifications and grades

## Conclusion

This comprehensive update transforms the Australian Steel Demand Model decomposition factors from a largely estimated baseline to an empirically-grounded framework. The research confirms significant structural changes in Australian steel demand, particularly the 38% reduction in manufacturing sector weight and 233% increase in renewable energy sector weight. With most factors now at medium to high confidence levels, the model provides a robust foundation for steel demand forecasting and policy analysis in the context of Australia's energy transition and infrastructure development priorities.
