# Track B Steel Taxonomy Analysis Summary

**Generated**: 2025-07-11 17:10:37

## Overview

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Track B hierarchical steel consumption forecasting taxonomy. Track B implements a 4-level hierarchical structure designed to capture the full spectrum of Australian steel consumption patterns from total demand down to specific client product specifications.

## Hierarchical Structure

### Level 0: Total Steel Consumption
- **Purpose**: Total apparent steel use (crude steel equivalent)
- **Coverage**: Complete Australian steel consumption
- **Data Source**: Aligned with Track A apparent steel use results

### Level 1: Major Product Categories (4 categories)
- **Total Categories**: 4
- **Categories**: SEMI_FINISHED, FINISHED_FLAT, FINISHED_LONG, TUBE_PIPE

### Level 2: Product Families (23 families)
- **Semi-finished Products**: Billets (Commercial, SBQ, Degassed), Slabs (Standard, Degassed)
- **Finished Flat Products**: Hot rolled coil, Cold rolled coil, Plate, Galvanized
- **Finished Long Products**: Structural products, Rails, Rebar, Wire rod
- **Tube and Pipe Products**: Seamless, Welded, Other tubular products

### Level 3: Client Product Specifications (25+ specifications)
- **Grade Specifications**: Grade 300, Grade 300+, etc.
- **Application-Specific**: Automotive, Mining, Oil & Gas applications
- **End-Use Categories**: Freight, Passenger, Heavy-haul applications
